            Working on the user interface presented us with a considerable
            challenge in view of the amount and variety of textbook material, as
            well as the occasional absence or incompleteness of relevant data.
            Some compromises and simplifications were necessary, which will be
            explained in more detail in the following lines.

          <p style="text-align: justify" id="index-p-d46e293">
            The criteria for the selection of textbooks included in the database
            were somewhat arbitrary. This applies especially to the beginning of
            the period in question, when the gap between the prescribed material
            and the texts that teachers and priests used to teach the youth was
            often significant. The gap between the prescribed textbooks and
            everyday practice gradually decreased during the period considered.
            In textbook material from the second half of the nineteenth century,
            especially in that which was created after 1869, there are
            significantly fewer outlined deviations. In the following lines, we
            will focus further on the criteria we used to classify the textbook
            material in the database.

              The bibliography is time-bound by the General School Ordinance
              from 1774 and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918.
              Naturally, some of the texts that were used in school lessons in
              the Theresian and Josephinian eras (and often later) were written
              before 1774. We included such textbooks in the review only where
              their use in the period after 1774 was sufficiently attested in
              sources and literature. It is, admittedly, possible, and indeed
              probable, that other older texts were also in use during that
              period. However, this is still open to further research. Even the
              year with which we conclude the bibliography was by no means an
              impenetrable barrier. Quite the contrary! Many textbooks were
              published in a more or less modified form also in the new state
              framework.<span id="ftn3_en_return"

              The area in question was part of the Habsburg Empire for most of
              the period under consideration. The exception is the period
              between 1809 and 1813 when parts of these lands were included in
              the French Illyrian provinces; we included the textbooks published
              during that era in the bibliography as well.

              Because the research project focused mainly on the development of
              Slovene nationalism, and due to time and practical limitations, we
              did not include a significant part of the textbooks and teaching
              aids in the Latin, German, Italian, Hungarian, and Croatian
              languages ​​in the database. We are aware that this is why a large
              part of the textbook material that was in use at major schools
              (Hauptschulen), normal schools (Normalschulen), and (later) either
              at so-called utraquist or bilingual elementary schools or at
              elementary schools (Volksschulen) with German or another language
              of instruction, and especially at high schools and Realschulen, is
              missing. In the future – either as a supplement to this
              publication or as part of further research – this material will
              undoubtedly need to be analyzed in more detail and included in the
              present corpus of textbook material.

            September 27, 1816, compulsory education was extended and ended with
            the completion of fifteen years of age, whereby in the newly added

            With the liberal school reform in 1869, the tendency towards a
            general eight-year compulsory school attendance came into force. The
            ideal of eight-year compulsory education was fully implemented only
            in Styria and Carinthia, but not entirely in the other provinces
            included in this bibliography. The right to shorten compulsory
            school attendance was given to:

          <p style="text-align: justify" id="index-p-d46e364">
            Especially in the earlier period, the records of authors' names and
            surnames were often inconsistent. In different editions of the same
            textbook or different textbooks by the same author, we often have to
            deal with different records of the authors' names and surnames. To a
            certain extent this is the result of changes in transcription, and
            partly the result of a decision to write the name in another
            language. It also happens that the author, to whom the authorship of
            the textbook can be attributed with a considerable degree of
            certainty based on sources and existing research, is not even
            mentioned in the textbook. Since strictly following the original
            inscriptions in each textbook would therefore cause unnecessary
            confusion and make it difficult for the user to perform a search, we
            have always used the standard version of the name and surname
            records. In doing so, we relied in particular on Slovene
            Biographical Lexicon and the Slovene library information system
            Cobiss as well as other relevant literature on the subject.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify" id="index-p-d46e366">
            In addition, for the sake of transparency, we listed the original
            authors separately – field: "Original author (if it is an
            adaptation) / Author (if it is an original work)" – and authors of
            later adaptations, translators, and editors – field: "Author of the
            adaptation / Translator / Editor." It must be pointed out in this
            regard that the distinction between the author of the original and
            the adapter is not always completely unambiguous. Some textbooks
            were published for a very long period of time. In such cases, the
            many rewritings of the textbook (many of which were created even
            after the death of the original author) could be regarded as an
            independent work without any particular reservations, and the author
            of the adaptation could be considered an author in the true sense of
            the word. Indeed, such decisions are always at least somewhat
            arbitrary. In order to avoid inconsistency, we decided on an
            approach according to which, even in cases of major revisions, we
            kept all later editions of a textbook in the same entry – in cases
            where we decided otherwise, we explained our decision to treat the
            textbook independently in the notes. Since numerous textbooks are
            translations, we have always listed translators in addition to the
            original author. The line between editor and author is often
            blurred. Especially in the case of readers and songbooks, the
            individual cited as the author was often not the author of the
            selected texts, but only a sort of editor. We only mentioned the
            editors in exceptional cases, when they were listed next to the
            author.

            happens that we know from the reports of contemporaries that the
            textbook was published earlier, but the first edition has not been
            preserved. At times it also happens that otherwise reliable sources,
            which talk about the textbook being published, do not contain
            information about the exact title. In such cases, we did not specify
            approximate titles. We have consistently adhered to the principle of
            keeping the title record – if at all possible – in its original
            form. Since the year is always added to the title, the reader will
            easily find out whether it is the title of the first edition or the
            first known edition of the textbook.

            on the mentions of the previous, inaccessible editions at the
            beginning of one of the textbooks that we had at our disposal.

            of years indicated in the field "Year (later editions)" and the
            years that are written in parentheses next to the different versions
            of the title. In this case also we have always tried to preserve the
            original format of the title. Years in parentheses refer to editions
            with the same title.

            Records of places of publication underwent many changes during the
            period considered. In part, it is a consequence of the absence or
            insufficient standardization of the language in which the textbooks
            used in the area considered were written. This is further
            complicated by the fact that the place was often written in Latin,
            German or some other language. In order for the present bibliography
            to be sufficiently transparent and, more importantly, to enable the
            user to use the database more efficiently, we have used the modern
            English versions of place names at all times.

            Changes and inconsistencies are even more pronounced when listing
            publishers than when listing place names. Standardization was
            necessary in this case as well. We realize that the way the name of
            the publisher was written (the same applies to the place name) is
            important and as such could be the subject of historiographical
            analysis, but in this case, ease of use prevailed over any such
            concerns. What is more, such a decision was also a consequence of
            the fact that we often relied on entries in the Cobiss library
            information system due to the abundance of material. Although the
            entries on the aforementioned system generally preserve the original
            notation, standardization still occurred, so that the recording of
            the original form of the publisher's name would not always be
            possible in any case. When standardizing, we mostly followed the
            record found in the Slovene Biographical Lexicon; when dealing with
            earlier periods we relied principally on the work of Anja Dular,
            Vlado Schmidt, and Ivan Andoljšek.

            the names of the publishers are listed first, followed by the
            surname. Thus, we followed the record that is in line with our
            standard, and not the original order. We have also at all times
            standardized the records of those publishing houses whose names did
            not derive from the personal name of the publisher. The place of the
